- In order to run the jasmine test use:
npx jasmine fetchUrlsWithConcurrency.spec.js

- The solution is the file fetchUrlsWithConcurrency.spec.js. I did it with jasmine because in Angular I use jasmine for testing. 
- Basically what i'm doing in the test is faking the fetch and measuring the active requests.
